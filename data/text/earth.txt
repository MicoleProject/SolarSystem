The earth is the only planet in the solarsystem who har water in liquid form on the surface. 
71 percent of the earth's surface is covered by wate.
The athmosphere of the earth mainly consists of nitrogen and oxygen. 
The athmosphere protects the earth and without it all heat would escape out in space.
The time it takes for the earth to rotate around its own axis is 24 hours or one day.
The earth has a moon and it rotates around the earth, one lap takes about 27 days and 8 hours.
The tempereture on the moon varies between +140 and -200 degrees.
The moon is so close to the earth that is looks as big as the sun but the sun is actually 400 times bigger than the moon.
The moon is the only place outside the earth the man has visited. This happend for the first time the twentyfirst of July 19 69 when the autronaut Neil Armstrong took the firts step on the surface of the moon after a loong trip in the spacecraft Apollo 11.
We always see the same side of the moon because the moon is rotating with the same speed as it is rotating around the earth.
With a telescope you can see, among other things, craters, mountains and creeks on the moons surface.
