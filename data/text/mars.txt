The size of Mars is approximately half the size of earth.
On the surface of Mars are craters which is created by both meteorites and big volcanoes.
A long time ago there where rivers and lakes on Mars but today the surface is dry and covered by red-brown oxidised iron. That is why Mars is called the red planet.
Mars has two moons. The moons are very small compared to Mars and the earth's moon.
Mars rotates around its own axis in 24 point 6 hours, that means that a day and night on Mars is only a half hour longer than on earth.
